🌟 1. Motivation for Reactive Systems : Handles Massive Concurrency( thousands of millions of request), low latency responses (real time UX), High Availabilty
Traditional architectures struggle to scale efficiently, especially when synchronous/blocking operations are used heavily.

🔧 2. Limitations of Traditional Architectures :
      Synchronous/Blocking: (Solved by virtual threads)
            Threads are blocked during I/O or processing, consuming system resources unnecessarily.
            You need a 1:1 mapping between requests and threads, limiting scalability (thread per request model)
      Tightly Coupled Systems:
            Failures propagate easily and recovery is hard.
            Poor fault isolation, brittle under load or failure conditions.

Key Takeaways:
        Traditional systems struggle with scalability and resilience under load.
        Reactive systems use asynchronous, non-blocking communication to handle more work with fewer resources.
